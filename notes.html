    CSS Changes
    </h1>
<p>
   In the website, if you hover over the pink tags, they change to the color yellow. Also we changed the tables to make them more eye appealing. Changed the borders around almost everything to make them eye appealing as well. We also used two different fonts to match with our beach/ocean vibes. The font is wavy to resemble waves in the ocean. Also in the profile picture page we changed the size of the picture so it didn't take up so much of the page.
